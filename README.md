# gold_recovery

Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.

The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification.

The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

The data is stored in three files:

* gold_recovery_train.csv — training dataset download
* gold_recovery_test.csv — test dataset download
* gold_recovery_full.csv — source dataset download

Data is indexed with the date and time of acquisition (date feature).
